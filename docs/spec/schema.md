# Mod Schema

The "mod schema" is an abstract representation of both necessary and unnecessary metadata provided by a mod.
The schema may provide crucial information such as a unique identifier and dependencies, as well as vanity and legal information such as authorship and licenses.

TODO: Base schema representation, extensibility, standardized file types?
